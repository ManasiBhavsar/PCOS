# PCOS
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that affects women of childbearing age. Women with PCOS have a hormonal imbalance and metabolism problems that may affect their overall health.
PCOS manifests as a variety of symptoms
The most common PCOS symptoms are missed , irregular , infrequent or prolonged periods . Other symptoms include :
•	Hair loss or hair in places you don’t want (like face ) from excess androgens
•	Acne
•	Darkened skin or excess skin on the neck or in the armpits 
•	Mood changes
•	Pelvic pain
•	Weight gain around middle 
No single test can diagnose PCOS. Doctor will start by asking about your symptoms and medical history and by doing a physical exam, and possibly a pelvic exam.
They might give  a blood  tests to measure  hormone levels, blood sugar, and cholesterol. An ultrasound can check ovaries for cysts, look for tumors, and measure the lining of uterus.
This is a classification problem . Here ,we are going to use the classification algorithms like logistic regression, SVM , Random Forest Classifier 



WORKING OF PROJECT 

•	Gathering the data of the patients . This data should include age , weight , height , BMI(Body Mass Index) ,blood group , pulse rate , respiration rate , Hb level , BP , cycle length , marriage status , is pregnant or not , number of abortions till date , TSH , LH , RBS and progesterone levels , follicle numbers and size , endometrium size of patient 
•	Set up data collection mechanisms to gather the data of the patients 
•	Clean the collected data to handle missing values and outliers and null values 
•	Perform feature engineering to create relevant features 
•	Perform feature scaling on the data to scale down the  range of values
•	Perform EDA on the data to gain insights from the data and find correlation between the columns and trends in the data
•	Visualize the data distribution and relationships between the variables
•	Identify most relevant features from the data  for predicting if the patient is suffering from PCOS or not  based on the domain knowledge 
•	Choose appropriate machine learning model to predict the output based on the type of target variables
•	Split the data into training and testing set
•	Train multiple models using different algorithms and the training data 
•	Find accuracy of each model and then decide which model is performing best 
•	Use ensemble  methods for improved accuracy 

ALGORITHMS USED 

•	Logistic Regression
•	Random Forest
•	Decision Tree
•	Naïve Bayes
